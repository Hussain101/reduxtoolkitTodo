This application is built in React and vite.
For the state management, I have used the react-redux toolkit. It's a practice project for this toolkit.
I follow this tutorial from the YouTube channel. I have added the following functionalities in it i-e my contribution are:

=> Add the update todo functionalities.
=> Add the Remove all Functionalities in it.
=> Use the TailwindCss for it.
=> I have also added the localstorage method which saves the todos on refreshing the page. Its also done through the redux.
Learn the basics of the react-redux toolkit from it.
